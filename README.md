# PWM Controller with Serial Peripheral Interface

This repository contains the design files and documentation for a **PWM Controller Chip** developed at the **Adaptive Heterogeneous Systems Laboratory**.  
The chip is designed to provide flexible pulse-width modulation (PWM) generation with an easy-to-use serial peripheral interface, enabling seamless integration with microcontrollers for embedded systems applications.

## Features

- **Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Generation**
  - Supports configurable duty cycle and frequency.
  - Multiple PWM channels (number depends on configuration).
  - Resolution and timing precision optimized for embedded control.

- **Serial Interface**
  - Simple serial protocol for configuration and control.
  - Compatible with common microcontrollers and SoCs.
  - Low-pin count interface for minimal I/O usage.

- **Scalable Design**
  - Can be used in standalone mode or as part of larger heterogeneous systems.

## Applications

- Motor control (DC, BLDC, stepper).
- LED dimming and brightness control.
- Power converters and switching regulators.
- Embedded control systems requiring flexible PWM generation.
